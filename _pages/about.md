I'm Taewoo Kang | Ph.D. Candidate in Information & Media **@** Michigan State University. 
My research program interrogates **the impact of digital platforms on civic life** through **the application of *quantitative* and *computational* methods**. [CV](https://kteen2k.github.io/taewookang/files/CV_TKang_Jun2025.pdf)

At the **micro level**, I investigate how digitally mediated communication shapes citizens’ socio-political attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors.
At the **macro level**, I explore the function of digital infrastructure on civic engagement.

Ultimately, my work aims to illuminate how *the **interplay** between micro-level digital practices and macro-level digital architectures can foster healthier **democratic processes***.

Recently, my micro-level research has focused on generative AI, particularly **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, both as a subject of inquiry and as a methodological tool in computational social science:

1. Testing the utility of LLMs as tools for analyzing media texts.<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.00903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>
2. Examining LLMs' potential to foster more democratic digital public spheres.<a href="https://cristianvaccari.com/2024/10/03/program-of-the-10th-conference-of-the-international-journal-of-press-politics-university-of-edinburgh-17-18-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>

On the macro side, I study how elements of digital civic infrastructure—such as broadband availability at the community level and digitally mediated civic communication among residents—shape patterns of political behaviors. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00936502241311943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2025.2511051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251315255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a>
